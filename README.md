**Created by Joshua Carisma | Technical Project Manager, PMP®, CSM**

---

## 🚀 Project Summary

This project simulates the role of a Technical Project Manager overseeing a high-priority EMR (Electronic Medical Record) module rollout at *Gotham General Hospital*, the city’s busiest trauma and research center. Using Excel, Power BI, and simulated data, this dashboard provides real-time visibility into the project lifecycle — tracking milestones, risk status, training progress, budget, and stakeholder alignment.

Built to demonstrate real-world healthcare PMO practices, data visualization proficiency, and cross-functional coordination, this project is part of a broader portfolio focused on digital health transformation and executive-ready reporting.
